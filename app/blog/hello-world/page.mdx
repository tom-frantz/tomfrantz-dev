So I've redone my site again ... Probably not my best choice, for CSS is a cruel god, but I've persevered over the last couple of weeks. It's been an interesting journey to say the least, but at least now I'm in a state of considered happiness. Yes, I should be proud of how much I've done.

For those of you who don't know me, I'm Tom. I like to describe myself as a turbo nerd, since my hobbies are programming, TTRPGs, and video games. I also like to cook, and my <FlashyLink href="https://milindi-kodikara.github.io/">girlfriend</FlashyLink> proudly exclaims I make a great Lankan chicken curry, "Grandma" level even.

I plan (ADHD permitting, of course) to write about anything that sparks my interest ... Probably mostly programming. I'm making a game (or three, but more on that later), so I want to share my progress and learnings as I go along. I also will write about my other nerd related things, no doubt, such as my TTRPGs.

See you soon,

Tom
