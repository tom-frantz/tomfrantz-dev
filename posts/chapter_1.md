So, in short, I spent the better part of a week figuring out how to get hexagons to show up on my screen. Roll up, roll up! For my self-deprecating humour will no doubt entertain for minutes!

## How it started
So, as you probably already know, the Queen (of England) died. This turned out to be a great thing for me. In conjunction to this, Her Majesty teamed up with the Cats and the Swans, to give me the best weekend I could've asked for. It was on this 4 day bender that I decided to try my hand at graphics shaders.

How hard could it be ..?

... _Oh boy._ 

So it seems like writing something for the graphics cards is a whole different ball game. Who could've guessed.

Thankfully I had a good friend at my side. [The WGPU Docs](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/) are made by what I can describe only as a chad of epic preportions. Without this bad boy, I would've been still trying to figure it out, no doubt. I also have to shout out to [bevy_ecs_tilemap](https://github.com/StarArawn/bevy_ecs_tilemap) and  [StarArawn](https://github.com/StarArawn) for giving me a killer example to follow in bevy. Armed with these, my trusty Bevy docs, and triangles, I set forth bravely to try and slay the dragon that was my GPU.


##### P.S.

I'm a bit of a slow writer, so It'll take me a bit before I write part 2. If you really want to know what I got up to, poke me, and I'll write faster.
