So I spent the better part of a week figuring out how to get hexagons to show up on my screen. Roll up, roll up! For my self-deprecating humour will no doubt entertain for minutes!

### How it started
So, as you probably already know, the Queen (of England) died. This turned out to be a great thing for me. In conjunction to this, Her Majesty teamed up with the Cats and the Swans, to give me the best weekend I could've asked for. It was on this 4 day bender that I decided to try my hand at graphics shaders.
