What's this, a chance occurrence?!

## Hello World

I'm Tom! It's a pleasure to meet you! Oh, you're also super interested in the niche subjects of [Polish communist maps](https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/s/r2y9u2) and Rust's type system?! Well, it's a pleasure to meet you too!

I'm sure this isn't the last I'm going to see of you, or if it is, I hope you live long, and prosper.

## What is this? Where am I?

Welcome, this is my personal website. As of today (11th of November 2022) I have got an assortment of things that vaguely interest me or I think are relevant to me. Hopefully you'll find my [GitHub](https://github.com/tom-frantz), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-albert-frantz/), and [my personal website](https://www.tomfrantz.dev/?recursive)

Feel free to shoot me an email at [thomas.albert.frantz@gmail.com](mailto:thomas.albert.frantz@gmail.com) if you ever feel like you want to chat!
